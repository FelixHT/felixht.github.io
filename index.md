<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Biography</h2>

I am currently a PhD candidate in the Biological Sciences Program at [UCSD](https://biology.ucsd.edu/education/grad/index.html), where I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Marcus Benna](https://biology.ucsd.edu/research/faculty/mbenna) and Prof. [Kay Tye](https://tyelab.org/kay-m-tye/). I received my MSc in Systems Biology at [Maastricht University](https://curriculum.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/master/systems-biology). I completed my master thesis on computational neuroscience working in the lab of [Stefano Fusi](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/stefano-fusi-phd) at [Columbia University](https://columbia.edu).  

My research is on how populations of neurons encode information within ethological contexts. Specifically, I am interested in how changes within an animalâ€™s internal state lead to changes within its neural representations and how these representations evolve over time. For instance, how chronic mild stress can induce depression.
